Welcome to a friendly notes that I wrote, which guides your through the basics to advanced. This notes not only documents the code but also my journey in wev development. So, Let's begin a wonderful Journey of developing and shaping the internet. 

## The journey :
### Points to remember:
1. <u>Spaced repetition:</u>
    Spaced repetition is a learning technique where you review information at increasing intervals over time. The goal is to remember things long-term instead of forgetting them quickly.
2. Interleaving Practice:
   Practise with small concepts
3. Active Recall:
   Quiz, practice and revising will efficient your progress.

Tip number 1: pace yourself. Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. Remember that it's better to code 30 minutes every day of the week, than to try and cram all your learning into one day. This is thanks to the important role that sleep plays in learning.

Tip number 2: routine is your friend. If you make a habit of waking up 30 minutes earlier every day, you can get in a coding session before you go to work. After a few weeks of doing this, it just becomes part of your routine. You don't really have to think too much about it, or expend any additional willpower. It's just something that you do.

Tip number 3: Use the Pomodoro technique. Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato. In Italy they have these tomato shaped clocks that you set for 25 minutes.

Final tip: remember to get plenty of sleep. You'll learn best when you're at your best. Sleep plays a vital role in how your brain learns. I encourage you to try to sleep at least 8 hours each night.
