## Div
So what is div , and how can we use div in the HTML? We can also use it in a very basic form without styling, to hold other elements together. So for example, we can create a div and put a heading in it, and put a paragraph in it, and now these two elements will be grouped together:
```html
<div>
  <h1>I am a heading</h1>
  <p>I am a paragraph</p>
</div>
